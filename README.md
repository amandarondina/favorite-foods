# favorite-foods
This is a part of last year's JavaScriptmas, a free annual festive coding event hosted by the online coding school Scrimba.<br>
I decided to use the challanges as inspiration for simple coding projects.

## Day 3
 >Favorite Foods - Topic: Object Destructuring 1. Edit the faveFoods object so that it contains your favorite foods. 2. Destructure the faveFoods object into three consts:  breakfast, lunch, and supper. 3. Fetch the meals <section> from the DOM. 4. Set the innerHTML content of the meals <section> to a paragraph that states what your favorite foods are for breakfast, lunch, and supper. Use a template literal to construct the string.

E.g.
For breakfast, I only like croissants ü•ê. For lunch, I love pasta üçù, 
and for supper I usually want pizza üçï.
